description: 'This dataset contains spike times from intracranial recordings taken
  in Wistar rats under 2% isoflurane anesthesia. Data was recorded using a TDT recordings
  system, and MUA recordings were spike sorted using the Plexon Offline Sorter to
  determine the spike times saved here. Event times for when ultrasound stimulation
  was delivered is also provided.

  In these recordings, we test different intensities and PRFs (pulse repetition frequencies)
  of ultrasound stimulation using a phased ultrasound array to stimulate the somatosensory
  cortex of rats. Recordings are taken using 32 channel Neuronexus electrodes. Ultrasound
  stimulation is delivered every 2.5 seconds, and each recording has either 200 or
  500 trials. '

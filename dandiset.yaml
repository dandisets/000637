description: 'In this study, we investigate the neuronal response to transcranial
  focused ultrasound (tFUS) stimulation on somatosensory cortex by using a 128-element
  array transducer. Intracranial recordings were performed using a 32-channel Neuronexus
  multi-electrode array from somatosensory cortex. Wistar rats were anesthetized using
  isoflurane at 2%. tFUS with different parameters was applied every 2.5s (±10%).
  Data was recorded using a TDT system and MUA recordings were sorted using the Plexon
  Offline Sorter to determine the spike times.

  This dataset contains spike times of the sorted neural signals and event time for
  each tFUS trial. In these recordings, we test different pulse repetition frequencies
  (PRFs) (30Hz, 300Hz, 1500Hz, 3000Hz, and 4500Hz), ultrasound durations (UDs) (100µs,
  200µs, and 400µs) of ultrasound stimulation to explore the neuronal response to
  tFUS. The pulse duration was kept at 67ms. Each recording has 500 trials.
